Applications for iPhone and Google Android centering around Vanderbilt University.

If you are using an iPhone, an iPod Touch, or any Android device, you will likely be intersted in the new Vanderbilt applications! Developed by students, for students, the Dining, Campus Map, and Events applications are now available in the Apple App Store and the Android Market.

Curious what these apps do?

### Dining ###

  * Locations that accept Vandy Card
  * Locations on/off campus
  * Locations that accept Meal Plan or Meal Money
  * Distance from your current GPS position
  * Time until location opens or closes
  * Alphabetical listing of locations
  * Kind of location (Sushi, Thai, etc)

### Campus Map ###
  * See all buildings on campus
  * "Live" search buildings
  * See building pictures, distance, and description

### Events ###
