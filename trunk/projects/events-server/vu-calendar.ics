SUMMARY:Teaching Workshop\: Writing a Teaching Statement
DESCRIPTION:Teaching workshops\, facilitated by CFT Graduate Teaching Fellows\, focus on issues particularly relevant to first-time teachers and are intended for graduate and professional students and post-doctoral fellows. Drawing on research-based approaches\, workshop facilitators will enable participants to identify and address common challenges and opportunities in their teaching practice.\nSince going on the job market often enough includes that you will have to be able to articulate your principle teaching values for a search committee of some kind\, this session will help you identify your core teaching principles and how they influence your teaching practice (current and anticipated). You will engage in questions such as &#39\;What is a teaching statement? What purpose does it serve on the job market and beyond?&#39\;  And finally\, &#39\;How can I create an effective teaching statement tailored to my specific purposes?&#39\;\n

SUMMARY:Free Online Chat\: "School Choice & School Improvement\: What have we learned?"
DESCRIPTION:\nWith the Obama administration highlighting school choice as a likely reform strategy\, interest in how parents choose a school is more intense than ever. What are the primary motivations of families for switching schools? How good is their information? And what are the broader – and often unintended – consequences of these kitchen-table decisions about education?\nEducation experts will discuss these issues and more in a free\, online chat\, “School Choice & School Improvement\: What have we learned?” hosted by the National Center on School Choice at Vanderbilt University  [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/schoolchoice/]and Education Week Nov. 17 at 2 p.m. ET.\nTo participate\, visit www.edweek.org/go/ncsc [http\://www.edweek.org/go/ncsc]. Questions can be sent to Marisa Cannata at schoolchoiceconference@vanderbilt.edu [schoolchoiceconference@vanderbilt.edu] until Nov. 16. The chat window will open at 8 a.m. on Nov. 17\, at which time questions can also be submitted.\nNo special equipment other than Internet access is needed to participate in this text-based chat.\nMarisa Cannata\, associate director of the National Center on School Choice\, will moderate the chat. Panelists are David Figlio\, Orrington Lunt Professor of Education\, Social Policy and Economics at Northwestern University and National Bureau of Economic Research\, research associate\; Helen F. Ladd\, Edgar Thompson Professor of Public Policy Studies and professor of economics at Duke University\; and Kristie J. R. Phillips\, assistant professor of sociology at Brigham Young University.\nThe chat will revisit key issues raised at the National Center on School Choice Conference held Oct. 25 to 27 at Vanderbilt\, which brought together 130 scholars\, graduate students and practitioners from 22 states as well as Australia\, Ecuador and The Netherlands. Practitioners included teachers\, school administrators\, state education officials\, foundation officers and representatives of advocacy groups.\nAt the conference\, school choice and school improvement issues were put under the microscope as researchers discussed school choice in its expanding array of forms\, including charter schools\, magnet schools and vouchers and inter- and intra-district choice programs.

SUMMARY:Parthenon Symposium - James Cowan\, Gentleman Collector
DESCRIPTION:Parthenon Symposium - James Cowan\, Gentleman Collector\nIn 1927 and &#39\;29\, Nashville received an anonymous gift of 63 paintings by American artists\; the name of the donor\, James Cowan\, was revealed upon his death in December of 1930. American painting was not particularly in vogue among collectors in the early part of the 20th century\, but in the decades since Cowan&#39\;s death these artists and their works have grown both in art historical importance and in aesthetic esteem.\nWho was James Cowan and why did he give part of his art collection to Nashville&#39\;s Parthenon? What was his connection to Nashville and why did he insist that his gift remain anonymous until his death? What motivated him to collect in the first place? How does he fit into the grand tradition of philanthropy that spawned a wave of museum building across the country during his lifetime?\nIn the symposium lecture on Tuesday\, November 17\, Jim Womack\, head of the Visual and Performing Arts Department at Montgomery Bell Academy\, will take a look at the man and his development as an art collector and philanthropist. He will explore Cowan&#39\;s idea of himself\, his reasons for collecting art\, his membership in New York&iacute\;s Grand Central Galleries and the significance of his choice to collect American paintings\, rather than European works.\nWomack holds an MA in art history from Virginia Commonwealth University. He has curated numerous art shows and is a frequent lecturer at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts. He has taught art history at MBA since 1979.

SUMMARY:Film\: The Other Side of Immigration
DESCRIPTION:Based on over 700 interviews in Mexican towns where half the population has left to work in the United States\, The Other Side of Immigration asks why so many Mexicans come to the U.S. illegally and what happens to the families and communities they leave behind. Through an approach that is both subtle and thought-provoking\, director Roy Germano provides a perspective on undocumented immigration rarely witnessed by American eyes\, challenging audiences to imagine more creative and effective solutions to our illegal immigration problem. 55 minutes.\nDiscussion led by Dr. Katherine Donato\, Chair of the Department of Sociology\, after the film screening.\nThis event is part of ISSS [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/isss] International Education Week

SUMMARY:Community Breakfast with M. Douglas Meeks
DESCRIPTION:M. Douglas Meeks [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/divinity/facultypages/meeks.php]\nThe Cal Turner Chancellor&#39\;s Chair in Wesleyan Studies and Theology\n"Lost in Wonder\, Love\, and Praise\: Worship in the Anglican and Wesleyan Tradition"\nIn May 2009\, as they have done every other year since 1999\, Prof. Douglas Meeks and writer Blair Gilmer Meeks took Divinity School students to England to study Anglican and Methodist Worship and Spirituality. The students find gracious hospitality for their stay at Sarum College in the Close of Salisbury Cathedral. The immersion experience includes visitation of important historical sites in Bristol\, Oxford\, and London.\nThis breakfast presentation will introduce you to the historical settings and rich experiences of the trip. Four students will also talk about their experiences from their various viewpoints.

DESCRIPTION:M. Douglas Meeks [http\://www.vanderbilt.edu/divinity/facultypages/meeks.php]\nThe Cal Turner Chancellor&#39\;s Chair in Wesleyan Studies and Theology\n"Lost in Wonder\, Love\, and Praise\: Worship in the Anglican and Wesleyan Tradition"\nIn May 2009\, as they have done every other year since 1999\, Prof. Douglas Meeks and writer Blair Gilmer Meeks took Divinity School students to England to study Anglican and Methodist Worship and Spirituality.

SUMMARY:Off the Wall Lecture Series\: "RE-ASSEMBLING REALITY\: Surrealism and Surrealist Film in 1920s and 1930s Paris"
DESCRIPTION:You have seen Twilight Visions\: Surrealism\, Photography\, and Paris and delved into the minds of the Surrealists. Now learn more about the tumultuous yet edifying times they lived in by attending the Frist Center's three part Off the Wall lecture series being held in conjunction with the exhibition. Kelli Shay Hix\, moving image archivist at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum\, will discuss the techniques and goals of the creators of selected early Parisian Surrealist films\, as well as the history behind their works.\n  Location\: Frist Center (Directions [http\://www.fristcenter.org/site/visit/])\nThe postÂWorld War I Parisian Surrealists used the mediums of writing\, painting\, and photography to expose the "superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations." But it was the medium of moving image film which gave the Surrealists the opportunity to create a nearly complete parallel world in which reason took a backseat to dreams\, and in which traditional editing processes were used to confuse\, rather than to clarify\, normal patterns of reason. Though entertaining\, these films are far from escapist. Much of the meaning in the films relies on the viewers' expectations\, reactions\, and interpretations of the films. This cinema is not meant to re-enact dreams or to tell a narrative\, but to acknowledge a reality "outside of all aesthetic and moral preoccupation."\n*Quotes are from The Surrealist Manifesto\, Andr&eacute\; Breton\, 1924\n
