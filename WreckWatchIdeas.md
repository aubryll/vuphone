Here's the original description from the email:

Wreck Watch: Students will write a smartphone application for
automatically detecting wrecks on roads. The application works by using
the accelerometer on the phone to detect a potential car crash. When a
violent acceleration is detected, a message is sent to a central server
with the time, acceleration data, and location of the event. If the
server sees a set of messages that occur close together and within a
short time period, it marks a map with that spot as a potential
accident. The server also uses the accelerometer data to try and
reconstruct the angle and velocities of the cars in the accident.
