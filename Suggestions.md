# Introduction #

Feel free to toss up any ideas you have for VU apps - either edit the page, or put them in the comments.


# Details #

<u>Vandy Vans </u>
  * See VV route info & current VV locations
  * Integrate with Nashville bus system to see buses and routes for nashville!
  * Include medical shuttles!

<u>Campus Maps</u>
  * It would be great if the VU stationary "you are here" maps around the campus had a note about downloading a live map. It would make it easier to get around once you left the map stand.
  * One thing I have noticed is that it’s hard to find any apps that show the tunnels. Would it be possible to create a tunnel map?  You could also the “Start” walking trails in this.  It would be very beneficial to walkers.
  * Hours of building operation. Specifically, the ability to check if a certain library is open or closed.

<u>Health</u>
  * Health Plus is the VU free gym. It would be great to have their current class schedule and updates as an app.

<u>Filtering library</u>
  * Using advanced knowledge of mathematical concepts, attempt to provide cleaner signals to other programs interested in signal input. A Kalman filter comes to mind, with the capability to input orientation, accelearation, GPS, etc, using all of these to result in cleaner measurement results

<u>Location-aware questions/polls/requests</u>

Do you think it would be feasible to enhance our various Vandy apps
to provide a service in which users can drop questions/polls/ requests
at a physical location.  These questions have an associated answering
zone (e.g. a radius around the question's location).  People entering
the answer zone will be notified of the question and can submit an
answer if they desire.  Using this infrastructure, various applications
(such as homework assignments involving questions tied to physical
locations, lost& found queries, neighborhood polling, audience of
customer feedback, etc) could be developed.  In addition, we could build
data mining services that will use the question/answer approach and then
use the resulting polling data (which is tied to foot traffic rather
than phone numbers) to reverse engineer demographic models and do new
forms of data analysis.

<u>ENT department app</u>
I read your article on apps and saw the video on YouTube. I am interested in having an application created for our department of otolaryngology. I know that there is one in the works for the medical center.  I was recently at a meeting with where I heard Dr. Scott Rogers, the associate dean for medical student affairs, speak about it. However, I was think that one that was specific to your department needs would be great. I really don’t know what it takes to do this, but I was hoping that someone could point me in the right direction. Thanks for the help. John W. Seibert
