## Reunion 2010 iPhone App ##
Submitted by:  Alumni Relations, Beth Dodd 3-2187; beth.dodd@vanderbilt.edu

## User Story ##
The objective of the Reunion 2010 iPhone app is to allow all iPhone users within the 5,000+ alumni who visit campus during Reunion and Homecoming weekend to:

  * Check event schedules and locations prior to and during Reunion/Homecoming Weekend
  * Share event info through facebook and/or twitter
  * Obtain last minute schedule or site changes throughout the weekend.
  * Find their way around campus to education events, class parties and mini-reunion gatherings of Special Interest Groups.
  * Communicate with their graduating class or SIG about where to meet up.
  * Share videos or photos, if possible, throughout the weekend.
  * Link to VUconnect (see notes below).
### Alumni Relations responsibility: ###
  * Ensure all events with details are properly loaded onto the University Calendar system, preferably with tags that may be used as filters.
  * Provide facebook fan page links for 11 classes.  May focus on younger graduates.
Possible filters:  11 reunion classes and Quinqs; SIGS like cheerleaders, ROTC, AVBA; education events; chancellor address or other keynote speakers; tailgate; class parties; other?
Discuss metatags – what level of detail and where does this data reside?
Note:  VUconnect is not mobile-friendly.  We may want to pursue designing a couple class notes pages for mobile, but it would not be a high priority – only if time allows.
